# Varibale In Batch
In a batch script, variables are declared using the SET command, with the format SET variable=value. For example, to declare a variable called "name" with the value "John," the command would be SET name=John. To use the value of a variable, use the percentage symbol followed by the variable name, like this: %name%.
